## R Markdown
Github Repo: <https://github.ubc.ca/MDS-2022-23/DSCI_521_lab4_ash2507.git>

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Markdown section -1 
Sample code for section 1 

```{r}
print(10)
```


## Markdown section -2 
Sample code for section 2 

```{r}
print("Created two sections")
```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
